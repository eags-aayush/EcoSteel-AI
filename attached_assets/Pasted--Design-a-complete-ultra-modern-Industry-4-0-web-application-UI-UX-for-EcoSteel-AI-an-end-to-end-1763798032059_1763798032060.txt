“Design a complete ultra-modern Industry 4.0 web application UI/UX for ‘EcoSteel AI’ — an end-to-end steel plant monitoring and optimization system that includes IoT sensing, AI, Digital Twin, Camera Detection, AR, and Multi-Furnace management. The interface should have a dark industrial theme (graphite black, neon green, steel blue), rounded glassmorphic components, glowing indicators, real-time animations, and a futuristic control-room look. Build the following pages: (1) Login/Signup with role selection (Operator/Engineer/Admin). (2) Multi-Furnace Dashboard showing real-time status cards for Furnace 1, Furnace 2, Furnace 3, etc., each card displaying temperature, emissions, purity, vibration, and an alert state (LIVE / OFF / WARNING). (3) Furnace Detail Page with five real-time widgets: temperature gauge with heat color animation, current & energy line charts, scrap purity bar, emissions AQI meter, and system status including vibration, door state, scrap sensor, gas spike alerts. (4) Digital Twin 3D View: a full-screen Three.js/Babylon.js styled panel showing a 3D furnace model where furnace color changes with temperature, smoke particles match emissions, conveyor moves with scrap load, door animation triggers from IoT, vibration visualized via shaking effect. (5) Scrap Detector Page: phone/web camera live feed with TensorFlow.js overlays detecting scrap impurities (rust, oil, plastic, dust), purity % indicator, confidence labels, capture button, and scrap history timeline. (6) Predictive Maintenance Page: machine vibration heatmap, RUL indicator (Remaining Useful Life), anomaly detection chart, bearing wear score, temperature deviation chart, alert history, and maintenance prediction graph. (7) Emission Monitor Page: gas concentration graph, air quality color zones, emission spike prediction, humidity correction, furnace-based emission comparison. (8) Scrap Quality History Page: timeline graphs, impurity type distribution bars, purity vs furnace performance heatmap, image gallery of captured scrap photos, export PDF button. (9) AR-Based Operator Guide Page using WebXR/AR.js layout: show a camera view with floating labels for furnace temperature, emissions, vibration, scrap purity, danger zone boundaries, and repair overlay instructions like ‘Check coolant valve’ or ‘High vibration detected—inspect bearing.’ (10) Reports Page: daily/weekly/monthly efficiency report cards, emission compliance report, scrap intake report, energy saving score, and export as PDF/CSV. (11) Settings Page: MQTT broker config, device management, threshold controls (temp/gas/vibration), theme toggle, user roles, and notification preferences. Use Tailwind-style clean layout ideas, neon highlight effects, animated gauges & real-time charts, floating cards, and professional industrial UX patterns. The final UI should feel like a futuristic steel plant control system with smooth transitions, glowing indicators, responsive design for mobile/tablet, and support for multi-furnace enterprise-level monitoring.”
